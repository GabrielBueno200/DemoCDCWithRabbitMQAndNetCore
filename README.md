> Change Data Capture (CDC) is a method of identifying and capturing changes made to a database. It captures data changes and enables businesses to keep track of all modifications made to their data, including updates, inserts, and deletes. CDC is a critical tool for businesses, particularly those who deal with large volumes of data, as it allows them to make better decisions by providing analysis.
